# Rabbithawk's Electron Init

This is a simple template I use to quickly create electron apps, and it contains all the fonts & CSS I use.

Due to github's limits,
I can't include the npm packages - they'll have to be installed seperately.

## Packages Used

* electron (npm install --save-dev electron)
* custom-electron-titlebar (npm install custom-electron-titlebar)

## Contents

* An improved index.html
* Improved index.js
* Custom CSS
* btw watch fireship
